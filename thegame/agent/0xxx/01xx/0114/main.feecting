## Terry Cooksey

link[Moose Mansions]:http://moosemansions.com/fools

#Terry #Cooksey gets his regular mention, surely the most multiply-nominated fool in the long and disreputable history of Moose Mansions. Mr #Cooksey, presumably a man of private means, appears to dedicate his entire waking life to spewing abuse almost indiscriminately via email and #IRC. He writes to one of our correspondents:

I will punish you for months for your criminal acts against me. Using copyright materials is NOT legal. I will NOT excuse you for it either. YOU will pay with #EVERYTHING you and YOUR #nazi parents own. I am in the process of filing a complaint in YOUR home town, and criminal charges will follow. YOU like committing your #nazi crimes; but YOU keep forgetting about THE #CONSEQUENCES.

I am the #GREATONE!

Don't mess with me, this is your only warning!

You can look forward to a year of nuking, #nazi fag boy!

### Scr1pt K1ddi3s guide to the Chaos Magick
In the first part of a series explaining the science behind different forms of modern mysticism, I will look at the quantum physics of the supernatural, the mathematical marvel that is Chaos Magick.

Let's start off with a deck of cards. Shuffle it, split, and shuffle again. Now turn over the top card. It should be the Ace of Spades. No? Just bad luck. Try again, and keep trying until it works. Practice makes perfect.

Now, if you've got half a brain, you should be thinking there's a 1 in 52 chance of the top card being the ace of spade, so it's bound to come out eventually, and you wouldn't be wrong. You see, while many uninformed people would assume the "chaos" in chaos magick refers to "the dark side", it infact refers to chaos theory, which states more or less that anything is possible, but some things are very improbable.

While many people will feed you bullshit saying you need to go through complex rituals to master chaos magick, you don't. A simple understanding of quantum mechanics and maths is all you need. Of course, being the bastard I am, I'm going to ignore the quantum mechanics side (my head hurts thinking about it), and focus on the chaos side of thing.

Chaos theory goes a little something like this: No matter how chaotic a closed system may be, there will always be a pattern in there. The universe is a closed system. Existence is a closed system. Nothing happens for the sake of happening. The cause of something happening may not be known, but it generates the effect, and the effect is constant, even though the cause may change.

And that is what you need to focus on, the effect. Back to our deck of cards. We want the top card to be the Ace of Spades. How can we do this? So far, we have only specified the effect, so the cause is still up for grabs. So, how about we remove every other card from the deck? Or have a deck of 52 Ace of Spades'? While this may seem like cheating, we have still acheived the effect.

The point of chaos magic is not how you do something, but that you actually do something by altering the probability of it occuring so that it is above 0.5. No rituals are required to do this, only an understanding of your environment.

J-I-N (Registed Nick Xnet) - Biggest asshole on #IRC, #Cooksey, you have nothing on this guy; goes mental after being kick/banned in #luckstruck for lurking for 30mins without saying anything and then repeatedly msg's ops for three days intermitant with ICMP/Ping Nukes (And then dening it when #luckstrucks IRCop OP's ask him about it despite the fact that most of it was logged) J-I-N your stupid fuck - get out more.
