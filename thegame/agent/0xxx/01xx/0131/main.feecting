In mid-December, some 30 seasoned information security professionals, "white hat" hackers and technologists formed Condemned.org, an activist group dedicated to "eradicat[ing] the existence of child pornography, pedophilia, and exploitation on the Internet."

As of its 10th day of operation, Dec. 21, 1999, Condemned claimed to have "eradicated" more than 20 kiddie-porn servers through proper legal channels, according to Kent Browne, a 40-year-old system architect for an East Coast consulting firm and spokesperson for Condemned.

Browne also claims members have hacked into more than 13 servers overseas and erased their hard drives.

quote: "They've (authorities) said to me, 'If you get up before any judge in the world, chances are he has kids and he's not going to convict you,' " Browne explains. "Who would? This is horrid, horrid."

Hey guys, this is RLoxley (Robin Hood of Loxley) from hackphreak.org.
I wanted to get my website in your ezine again, and tell everyone how ethical hacking is the best hacking ever. I have included bronc's bash history from one of my machines. Also, remember young hackers, if you break into a system, tell the admin how to patch it, do a good deed for society. If you hack any child porn people, turn them into authorities and send all of the downloaded movie/picture evidence to my personal account: rloxley@hackphreak.org. Stop child porn!


note: Asking people to send what they download to his personal email account.
