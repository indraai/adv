::BEGIN:LOOK
A Master Artist twirls a paint brush between his fingers. He has probably killed more people than the number of days you have lived. He looks hard, the kind of hardness that comes from watching people die and seeing how fragile life can be.  He acknowledges you with a nod and seems to wait patiently for something.
