## Quinn
Hi, I'm Quinn. Well, not really. That's my code name. In any case, I'm me, and this is my "homepage". In the early days of the web, we had these things instead of Facebook accounts. They were so called because that little tilde in the address is Unix shorthand for your home directory, and that's where this file resides. That little tilde is Unix shorthand for the home directory because on ancient keyboards it shared a keycap with the "home" function.

The apocalypse is a collective nightmare. Fading. Few remember what happened, and no witness lives to tell. Sometime, somehow, two millenia of civilization collapsed into dust.

The past is a bleached skull on glowing sand. The future is now, and humanity crawls forward, shaking off its holocaust ashes.
