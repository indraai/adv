A merry old man with rosy-red cheeks and a full white beard is dressed all in red. "Santa Claus" is the American version of St. Nicholas, who originally descended from the Dutch Sinte Klaas. Santa's gift-giving role in Christmas rites follows from his fame as the friend of children. His story also tells that he used to give donations o spread to Europe and Chritmas presents were distributed on Dec. 6 during the pageant of St. Nicholas. In many countries, this day is still the day of gift-giving although in America it's celebrated on Dec. 24 and 25.
