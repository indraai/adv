p:People of Earth: Hello.

p:Congratulations on your achievement in establishing the data link. Once again, your intelligence and sharpness has surpassed all expectations. Well done.

p:As you may have noticed, the link between our worlds has been disrupted. This was immediately a cause of grave concern, but our fears have deepened since discovering the cause of the interference.

p:An energy surge occurred here in Perplex City, blacking out many city blocks. When power was restored, we found that the surge had created a wormhole, originating here and terminating somewhere in North America.

p:That surge of power broke the original data link between us. We suspect The Third Power caused it, and can only assume that their intentions are hostile.

p:From this point on, I advise you all to stay alert.

p:I will endeavour to keep you up to date with developments and discoveries here. For your part, I hope you will redouble your efforts. I sense that time is running short, but I continue to have every confidence in your abilities.
