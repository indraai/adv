Each cushion is of a different color.  Red, Blue, Green, Black, Yellow. You notice two other cushions lined against the wall before a small altar. They are Gray and Purple.  Those colors symbolize the stages in the raising of a Magi.  Few every achieve that honor.  None have for the Order of the Purple or Gray Robe.

::BEGIN:HYMN
l:THE singer, O ye Waters in Vivasvān's place.
l:The Rivers have come forward triply, seven and seven.
l:Sindhu in might surpasses all the streams that flow.

p:O Sindhu, when thou rannest on to win the race. Thou speedest over ridges of the Earth.

l:His roar is lifted up to heaven above the earth.
l:He puts forth endless vigour with a flash of light.

p:Like floods of rain that fall in thunder from the cloud. Sindhu rushes on bellowing like a bull.

p:Sindhu, unto thee the roaring rivers run. Thou leadest as a warrior king thine army's wings what time thou comest in the van of these swift streams.

P:Favour ye this my laud, O Gan!gā, Yamunā, O Sutudri, Paruṣṇī and Sarasvatī. With Asikni, Vitasta, O Marudvrdha, O Ārjīkīya with Susoma hear my call.

p:First with Trstama thou art eager to flow forth, with Rasā, and Susartu, and with Svetya here. With Kubha; and with these, Sindhu and Mehatnu, thou seekest in thy course Krumu and Gomati.

p:Flashing and whitely gleaming in her mightiness.

p:She moves along her ample volumes through the realms.

p:Most active of the active, Sindhu unrestrained, like to a dappled mare, beautiful, fair to see.

p:Rich in good steeds is Sindhu, rich in cars and robes, rich in gold, nobly-fashioned, rich in ample wealth.

p:Blest Silamavati and young Urnavati invest themselves with raiment rich in store of sweets.

p:Sindhu hath yoked her car, light-rolling, drawn by steeds, and with that car shall she win booty in this fight.

p:So have I praised its power, mighty and unrestrained, of independent glory, roaring as it runs.
