The city to the north is covered in shadows and gloom, the Artist Quarter. To the east one can see the gate and a long warehouse.  The Temple of Arjika rises above to the southwest.  A light breeze brings a bit of refreshment and a strange smell.  Few people know, or want to know, what lies beyond the city walls and the safety of the firmament.  A stone stairwell leads down to the inner city.
