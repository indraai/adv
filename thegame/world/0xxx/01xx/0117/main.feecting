::BEGIN:MAIN
This room stands empty as it is being prepared for a portal summoning.  The walls are glistening white plaster with a vaulted ceiling.  Powerful mages are said to be able to create portals through their arcane arts, though many die in the process. The skill is as of yet unmastered.

It is rumored that the evil Drakkar has achieved this mastery, but none have ever witnessed it.
