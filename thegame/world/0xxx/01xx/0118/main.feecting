On top of the battlements one has access to a good view of the eastern side of the city.  To the north can be seen the Artist Warehouse, to the south the Mansion of the Magi.  The Temple of Arjika rises from the center of the city to the west.  All looks well from this perspective.  It is not possible to see beyond the city walls.
