Here, one finds themselves in a place of non-existence.  The walls recede from vision until all that is visible is a bleak grayness.  Nothing can any longer be discerned in three dimensions.  The floor, ceiling, and sky all are the same bleak gray color.  It is here the Magi come to test their mystical arts.  It is not a good place to get lost in.
