Within the halls of this tower lies the Orb of Arjika.  It is the responsibility of all to ensure its safety.  Without the orb the firmament would collapse and chaos would rule.  The Magi have been given the honor of it placed within these halls.  The orb is rumored to have been created by the Gods Rumble and Ferret.  But, no one knows for sure.
