This is a meeting room of the higher level mages who are seeking to become a Magi.  It is here they must prove themselves both physically and mentally. Most never make it.  The Magi of the Purple and Gray robes has never been achieved.  The actual testing to be a Magi remains a mystery as only the Magi themselves have witnessed it.
