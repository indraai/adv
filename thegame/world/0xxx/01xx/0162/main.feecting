A strange smell comes from the north, the unforgettable smell of tanning hides.  Must be the towns leather shop.  Tall buildings to the south must be the houses of the locals.  Probably shouldn't go wandering around, this place is full of artists as it is and it would be easy to be mistaken for one.
