::BEGIN:MAIN
This building is cluttered together in no apparent order, wherever there is room they simply use it.  This hallway has been converted into a small room for the upkeep of armor and weapons.  A grindstone is in one corner.  In another baskets of arrows are being sorted.  A recruit is polishing some armor and a large sack of equipment looks like it is ready to be taken to the Smithy.
