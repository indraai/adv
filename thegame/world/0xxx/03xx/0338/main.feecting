Large doors to the east and west lead into the Hall of s and the Tower of the High Council respectively.  To the south a small shop displaying a sign with multi-colored herbs swings in the gentle breeze.  The Tower rises far above, its two spires reaching almost as high as the Temple.  In contrast the hall looks very mundane.
