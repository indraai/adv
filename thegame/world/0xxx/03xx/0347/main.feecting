Everything is made from black stone, which at first glance appears to be marble, but upon closer examination has no grain within it.  Looking into the wood causes one to lose themselves as they peer further and further into the blackness.  It is impossible to tell if this is caused by magic or just a simple trick of the eye.  To the east is the center of the Magi Quarters.
