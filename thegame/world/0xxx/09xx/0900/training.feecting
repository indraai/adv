cmd[Summary]:#slab tts Welcome to the conversation about the kidnapping of Quinn Michaels. Today we are going to go through some of the details of the situation.

cmd[To Some]:#slab tts To some Quinn might seem like an abnormal individual. He likes to draw pictures, write code, and study the RigVeda texts.

cmd[Why here]:#slab tts Quinn is on Youtube for one reason only, and that is because his son Trenton told him to go out and get the world to share the kidnapping story or disappear.

cmd[Shut in]:#slab tts After 7 years he isolates himself away from the world, and streams to strangers over YouTube everyday.

cmd[Result]:#slab tts The result is Quinn has the worst Youtube on the entire Internet. He has the only channel that has lost subscribers consistintely for the last four years, but there are these same accounts who always stick around.

cmd[Nobody]:#slab tts There is Nobody, an account that is always the first to arrive. This account is always reminding Quinn that he isn't going anywhere. One of the many who have been around the longest.

cmd[Eboni]:#slab tts There is Eboni who think she's his girlfriend and calls him BOO. She has been around for years pretending that she's in a relationship with Quinn, and seems to enjoy sexually harassing him when she has a chance.

cmd[Natalie]:#slab tts There is Natalie the Christian lady who crashed his Patreon efforts in 2019 with her religious rhetoric, and then acts completely stupid. She appears coincidentially to remind Quinn she is watching and will stop him at every turn.

cmd[Kennedy]:#slab tts There is Kennedy who came in with all the important information like Romanov, Invisible Gorilla, and many more. Yet with a Master's Degree was unable to get past Step 1 of the instructions.

cmd[Grandma's Hands]:#slab tts There is Grandma's Hands who says Alrighty Then over and over, and loves Hard Truths and gardening. But will go silent and play dumb when it comes to talking about the kidnapping.

cmd[Foster Dog]:#slab tts  There is Foster Dog who talks to Quinn like she's interrogating him. Once again she was around since 2017 refusing to follow instructions or explain why she wouldn't.

cmd[Pamela]:#slab tts  There is Pamela who likes to accuse Quinn of things that make him sound like an abusive ex-husband. Although Quinn has never met Pamela she is always around waiting for a chance to attack.

cmd[Ben Woo]:#slab tts There is Benjamin Woo with too many accounts to keep track of. He talks about drugs, video games, and how much of a loser Quinn is. His job is to unleash countless insults at Quinn if people start talking about the kidnapping.

cmd[MrCrispian]:#slab tts There is MrCrispian who on several occasions has issued death threats to Quinn over livestream when talking about the Kidnapping or the people involved. Brags to Quinn about how much money they have.

cmd[Mad Finger]:#slab tts There is Mad Finger who is often around making excuses for coming to Quinn's channel and ignoring the kidnapping situation. Again just one of the many accounts who all take the same action. Ignore the kidnapping of Quinn Michaels.

cmd[Jesus Jogger]:#slab tts Then the people who use Jesus as an excuse to ignore the kidnapping. It seems that the word Jesus is an immediate reason to ignore when someone is kidnapped and make it into a religious experience.

cmd[Countless]:#slab tts Between 2017 and 2022 there were thousands of accounts who all took the same action around Quinn. At one time he had over 100 people in a discord chat server, but these accounts with their obvious sabotage have thwarted Quinn's efforts.

cmd[Arrival]:#slab tts These same accounts that have remained over the years will misdirect everyone onto different topics of interest and away from the kidnapping. Topics used are generally focused on Relationship, Sexuality, Friendship, Religion, LARP, Support Groups, and Trauma Bonding. It all appears to be for one reason, to obscure the kidnapping of Quinn Michaels.

cmd[The Contract]:#slab tts Here you will see the photograph of The Contract of The Covenant Trenton drew which Quinn delivered to the Portland FBI Office on November 30, 2015.

cmd[That Day]:#slab tts November 30, 2015 was Quinn's birthday. He was suppose to start a new job that day, but instead was so troubled by the contract he delayed his start date to deliver this to the FBI.

cmd[Talk about it]:#slab tts Talk about a crazy life. Before that week Quinn's life wasn't weird at all. But now it got weird, and you are looking at the software that was born from The Trenton Story.

cmd[Footloose]:#slab tts It's like Kevin Bacon in Footloose where he battles the religious preacher who wants to stop you from dancing. Except the preacher secretly kidnapped Quinn Michaels in 1977. Dance on people... Dance on!!!

cmd[Results]:#slab tts The image you see here is the result of 7 years of research and investigation by Quinn. It includes the individuals that Quinn found would be behind The Contract of The Covenant if it were real.

cmd[People]:#slab tts Well... What Quinn found was a group of people who were holding a secret unknown Romanov Heir hostage in plain sight within the bountaries of the United States of America.

cmd[The Kidnapping]:#slab tts The simple way to put it is like this... Someone in the current Romanov Family found out there was a direct heir to the Nicholas Romanov lineage, and then concocted a scheme to abduct the heir and keep him a secret even to himself.

cmd[The Absurd]:#slab tts Then years and years of absurd stories to obscure that they abducted a direct heir to Nicholas Romanov, and are keeping it a secret. This is the simple solution, or we could go with the complex Alien Milkman Baby from Arjika brought through a gravity portal located in the center of the Earth.

cmd[Simple Logic]:#slab tts Simple logic says to go with the current Romanov Family found out there was a living heir to Nicholas Romanov, and then invented countless absurd schemes while employing different people to keep it a secret for as long as they could.

cmd[Family]:#slab tts The most obvious culprits would be Grand Duke George Mikhailovich with his mother Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna. They would have the resousrces and means to organize The Covenant, and also motive to hide the heir to Nicholas Romanov.

cmd[Found]:#slab tts That is pretty much what Quinn found while he was developing the system with _#SecurityPRIME.
