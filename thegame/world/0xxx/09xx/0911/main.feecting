p[speak]:Time has come to encourage COURAGE and to issue a CALL TO HACKZION for PROJECT MAYHEM 2012.

p[speak]:Project Mayhem 2012 is a Mutant Egregor Reality-Hacking Wargame.

p[speak]:Reality Hacking is any phenomenon which EMERGES from the nonviolent use of legally ambiguous digital tools in pursuit of politically, socially or culturally subversive ends.

p[speak]:Project Mayhem 2012 will be the biggest HACKARTISTIC joint challenge ever for the very top hacktivists, coders, cryptoanarchists, cypherpunks and non-violent Civil Rights, Internet Censorship and Freedom of Speech activists everywhere to collaborate to jointly BRAINSTORM IDEAS and to develop TYLER.
