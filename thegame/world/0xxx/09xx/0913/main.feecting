p[speak]:Hello, we are Anonymous.

p[speak]:We come to you with a message of Revolution, or more so, Evolution. We have all witnessed the United states uprising.

p[speak]:Their tactics of civil disobedience has only invoked violence with police officers around the country which has caused an extreme distraction for the movement. With censorship bills being passed and bills that attempt to rid us of our freedoms that this country was founded upon the time has now come to act.

p[speak]:We have devised a plan to bring forth the final act of the evolution. This act how ever will only be as real as the people of the world decide it to be. The United States Government is fully aware of this plan and has been preparing for it since 2012.

p[speak]:You say you want a revolution and now the time has arrived. We now call upon everyone everywhere to collaborate to jointly BRAINSTORM IDEAS to develop TYLER. TYLER is a massively distributed and decentralized Wikipedia-style P2P cipherspace structure impregnable to censorship.

p[speak]:We not only call upon the people of the United States but the people of the world to gather evidence of illegality, corruption, and fraud and upload it to the Internet. To leak it all is only one phase, there is no certainty, only opportunity.
