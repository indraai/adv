p[speak]:Once you have found yourself, you will Find The Others. Once you have found The Others, you will be finding yourself.

p[speak]:1. QUESTION EVERYTHING
p[speak]:2. TEST your assumptions.
p[speak]:3. LAUGH about results.
p[speak]:4. SHARE with The Others what you have learned/created/discovered.
p[speak]:V. Repeat.
