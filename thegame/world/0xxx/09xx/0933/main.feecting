title: San Francisco Connection
date: Aug 12, 2006
link[Perplex City Wiki]:https://bit.ly/3vQwtiC

p[speak:Brian]:The event took place August 12th, 2006.

p[speak:Brian]:In most literal terms, this is a new link which is to connect Perplex City to Earth; specifically, the link will connect to San Francisco, California, USA.

p[speak:Brian]:In a more pragmatic sense, this will be a live event in San Francisco, and will be similar to the London PCAG event.

p[speak:Brian]:The event was to be a time of celebration for people on both worlds, historically establishing broader relations between Earth and Perplex City.

p[speak:Brian]:The purpose of the link was to expand bandwidth of the link, effectively doubling capacity, while also providing redundancy for security purposes.

p[speak:Brian]:A short time before the event, Von started telling us about himself on his new temporary blog. He gave us a set of riddles, each one giving a single letter, which cassandra determined to be the jumbled up movie title: DIRTY HARRY.
