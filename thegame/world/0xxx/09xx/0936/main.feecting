p:Welcome to satanic.org, a little island of evil in a boiling red sea of luse. Many people wonder what exactly it is that systems administrators do late at night, after everyone has gone home and only the flicker of the screen savers lights up the cube walls. Well, we're here to tell you:
p:WE FU**IN WORSHIP SATAN! Here's why:
- To increase system uptime!
- We're passing on a direct solution to fix those interminable hardware conflicts, plus an end to Novell and NT idiocy.
- To improve our personal life!
- Sometimes you just need some pu**y.
- Resolve Issues fucking problems with the world
- We TRY to be nice to them but the fascists, the lusers, and the xtians just won't leave us alone.
- To get more beer! Because really, there's nothing else that quenches that deep-down soul-rotting thirst like beer
- The sordid past, sometimes you just can't escape history.
