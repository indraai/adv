## Glaciers Edge
p:Now you stand at the edge, lost in thought
p:How could the crevasse have no bottom? Could it really lead to an underground kingdom? What happened to Dr. Vivaldi?
p:But your thoughts are shattered. You didn't seem to slip, yet suddenly you are falling into the crevasse! A ledge is coming up fast beneath you.
p:You could land on it, but you're falling so fast you're sure to be badly injured. You might only be saving yourself for a slow, agonizing death.
p:These thoughts race through your head in a split second.
