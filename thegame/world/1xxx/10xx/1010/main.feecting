## The Great Bird

p:You stand there and watch as the strange creature walks slowly toward you. Then you see the large, blue-white pieces of broken shell. This angel bird is only a fledgling, just hatched!

p:Losing your fear, you walk up and stroke the creature gently. It cocks its head to the side and touches you with one of its wings. At that moment it seems almost human.

p:But suddenly you hear a loud whirring sound. Hovering above you is another angel bird, a much larger one. It must be the mother of the fledgling. She swoops toward you.
