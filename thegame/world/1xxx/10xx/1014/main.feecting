## You Lunge For The Baby Bird

p:You lunge for the baby bird, hoping that you can use it as a shield.

p:Even as you move, you feel a rush of wind as the mother dives to protect her baby. You realize that you've just made the stupidest decision of your life.

p:Strangely, the mother bird did not harm you.

p:Instead, you feel that you have been put into a trance. Stranger still, you sense that something has set time backâ€”that you are being given another chance!
