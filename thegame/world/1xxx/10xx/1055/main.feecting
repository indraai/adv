The Raka hunters are clumsy at rowing, and
the boat is so heavy that a few small waves would
easily swamp it. You realize you might be able to
swim to shore before the Rakas could turn
around and catch you. It's risky, but it's your only
chance to avoid the war!
If you dive overboard and swim for shore,
turn to page 61.
If you stick it out in the war boat,
turn to page 62.
