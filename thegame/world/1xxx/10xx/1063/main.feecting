Your raft floats on past marshy banks and
yellow clay islands. The river grows narrow as it
flows through a deep canyon. Rock cliffs rise up
on both sides. You hold on, hoping to reach a
place where you can land.
Never have you experienced as dark a night as
this. It's as if the river were flowing through a
tunnel somewhere in the depths of the earth.
Finally you sleep, and it seems as if a very long
time has passed when you awake and find your
raft pitching up and down. Why has the river
grown so rough? It's still too dark to see much,
but at least the stars are out.
Stars? There aren't any stars in the Underground
Kingdom. You're not on the riverâ€”you're
on an ocean!
